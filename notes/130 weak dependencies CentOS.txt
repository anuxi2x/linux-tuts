we have different levels of dependencies:
required dependencies:
essential for our software and without these, we cant execute the program

weak dependencies:
optional software dependencies
they enhanced the functionality, but arent required

types of weak dependencies:

recommends:
package recommends another package
most users would also want to install this other package

suggests:
The package can use another package - but usually we wouldn't need this other package

by default:
DNF will install recommended weak dependencies as well (if it doesn't trigger a conflict)

list recommended weak dependencies:
dnf repoquery --recommends [package_name]

list suggested weak dependencies:
dnf repoquery --suggests [package_name]

if we want to disable weak dependencies:
we can set this option in /etc/dnf/dnf.conf:
install_weak_deps=false

or set is as a parameter when installing:
dnf install [package_name] --setopt=install_weak_deps=False
