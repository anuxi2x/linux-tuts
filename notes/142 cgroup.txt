cgroup

control groups (cgroup) are a feature of the Linux kernel
it organizes processes hierarchically
and allows us to more evenly distribute system resources
systemd heavily relies on cgroup to manage processes

advantages:
a cgroup can span multiple processes - and even contain other cgroups
if we start a sub-process it will automatically be in the same cgroup as the parent

uses of cgroups include:
resource limiting:
    we can configure a cgroup to not exceed a specific memory limiting
    we can define how much % of CPU resources this cgroup may occupy
    we can also measure how much resources certain system consume .. or freeze a group of processes
    this can be useful when multiple services (in an application sense) / containers share the same server

show processes on our system:
systemctl status

if we want to inspect cgroups:
systemd-cgtop

buy default it displays up to 3 levels of cgroup

to change level:
systemd-cgrop --depth=[level]

example for cgroups: Firefox @ 100MB

first step: we need to create a systemd slice in our user account.
~/.config/systemd/user/browser.slice

browser.slice:
[Slice]
MemoryHigh=100M

after this, we can launch Firefox from executable is placed
/usr/bin/firefox or to check where is the executable just run forefox and inspect the executable location with:
ps -ef | grep firefox

system-run --user --slice=browser.slice /usr/bin/firefox

important:
if the firefox executable is a script... the script might change the cgroup configuration
in this case, we need to find out the real path to the real executable of firefox
