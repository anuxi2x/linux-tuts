environment variables are written in uppercase letters

list all variables with 'env' command

example for accessing variable (preferred way):
echo "${PWD}"
echo "${USER}"
echo "${PATH}"
echo "${OLDPWD}"
echo "${HOME}"

HOME:
stores the current users home directory PATH
/home/username or /Users/username (for MAC)

PWD:
stores the current working directory PATH

OLDPWD:
stores the last working directory

USER:
stores the current users username

example for accessing variable (another way):
echo "$PWD"
echo "$USER"
echo "$PATH"

we should avoid of this way for accessing variable:
echo $PATH
echo $USER
echo $PATH
