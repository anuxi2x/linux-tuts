umask allows us to specify who should be able to access new files
by default 777 for directories and 666 for files
if we set umask to 022:
directories will have 755
owner: read+write+execute
group and others: read+execute(but not write)
and files will be 644:
owner: read+write
group and others: read (but not execute+write)

to show current umask value:
umask

its available for session, to change it permanently ~/.bashrc
usually we can edit /etc/login.defs file

be aware:
changes umask command in a shell overwrite this for the current shell session
make sure that the umask is not overwriten during startup of the shell
