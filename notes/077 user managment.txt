user information is stored in various files:

/etc/passwd:
contains basic user account information
usernam, user ID (UID), group ID (GID), user description (full name), home directory and default shell
readable by all users

/etc/shadow:
stores encrypted user passwords and password aging information
stores additional information, such as the date of the last password chande, expiry dates and etc.
readable only by the root users

for passwords in /etc/shadow:
* - there is no password, no loggin allowed
! - technically login is allowed, but password is locked

/etc/group:
contains information about the groups, and their members
readable by all users

to create user:
useradd [options] username

the most important options are:
-m: create home directory
without -m user will be a service
-d: set custom home directory
-s: specify defailt shell

managing groups:
-g: specify primary group instead of using default config
often, default configuration is that a new group will be created with the same name as the username
-G: add user to a secondary groups

to set password for users:
passwd [option] [username]

the most important options:
-S: display password status
-d: delete password
-n: set minimum password age (days)
-x: set maximum password age (days)
-l: lock user account
-u: unlock user account

/** passwd -S 
jannis P 03/29/2023 0 99999 7 -1
P - regular password
03/29/2023 - change date
0 - can change password every day
99999 - number of days until my password will expires
7 - noticed 7 days before my password expires
-1 - if my password expires i can log in
**/

to modify another users details:
usermod [option] username

the most important options:
-c: change full description (full name)
-s: change default shell

we should really consider if we want to use those options:
-d: change home directory
-m: to also move the existing home directory to the new location
-l: change username

managing groups:
-g: change primary group
-G: change secondary group
-aG: add secondary group

/** sudo usermod -s /bin/bash -c 'Lauren M.' lauren **/

to delete users:
userdel [options] username

options:
-r: removes the home directory + mails
-f: removes the home directory + mails. Forces the removal of the user, even if the user is still logged in.
Might also delete a group with the same name as this user depending on system config
