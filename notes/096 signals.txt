signals specific kind of massages and they will interrupt the process flow at a convenient (iran harmar) time
its a mechanism to asynchronously notify a process of an event

operating system is responsible for delivering the signal to the process
maintains a signal queue, so we can send a signal to every process (even to one that is not active right now)

signals interrupt the normal process flow over process and process is forced to handle signal first and the it can resume to normal stuff
