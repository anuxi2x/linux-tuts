imagine that we running ping command in the background

to list all background jobs:
jobs
output will be:
[1]+ Running {ping command}

to move job from background to foreground:
fg [%job-ID]

if we have 1 job also can use only fg command

If there're multiple jobs, it will switch to the current job (marked with a + in the jobs table)

important:
only foreground jobs can receive keyboad input and signals
this will only ask foreground jobs / processes to quit themselves
but it will not work for background jobs
