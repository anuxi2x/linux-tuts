rpm are archives that contain all the files & configuration required to install a software

we could download rpm files manually from:
https://mirror.stream.centos.org/
we should usually avoid this, as it can easily lead to conflicts

to inspect rpm file:
rpm -qpl [file_name].rpm

to install:
sudo rpm -i [file_name].rpm

to uninstall:
sudo rpm -e [file_name].rpm

-e: erase
-i: install

in practice dont recommended to use -e or -i for dependencesies reason. we should use dnf to install and uninstall
