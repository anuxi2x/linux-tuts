sed allows to easily executo commands on a file or on stdin

syntax:
sed 'command1; command2; ...'

commands can modify the string, such as:
delete lines
insert lines
replace lines (most common use case)

syntax for replacement:
sed 's/[pattern]/[replacement]/[flags]

replaces string with another
the most common flag is 'g':
this means we want to replace all occurrences, not just a firts

there rae several different implementations of sed
for example:
OS X uses an implementation from FreeBDS from 2005...
Linux usually uses GNU sed
this means for us:
most of the code workes exaclty the samo on each platform
however there might be some minor differences
(especially when running comples sed commands)
