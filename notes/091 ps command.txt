ps - Process Status
Displays information about running processes
Useful for monitoring system resources
It works (almost) the same on macOS and Linux

ps -A, ps -e: 
Show all processes, from all users and all sessions

ps -f:
Full-format listing: Show extended information, such as user, terminal, and parent process (PPID)

ps -p 1234,1235:
Show processes with process ID 1234 and 1235
We are also allowed to omit (leave out) the -p, and even the comma:
ps 1234 1235

ps --forest:
Only Linux: Show the processes as an ASCII tree

ps -l:
Show entries in long format (a few more columns)

Linux uses POSIX standart, MacOS uses BSD 

POSIX - Portable Operating System Interface (IEEE 1003)
