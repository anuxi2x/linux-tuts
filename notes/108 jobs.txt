a job is a command that is being executed

a job can consist out of multiple programs:
cat file.txt | wc
in this case, we have 2 programs that are being executed at the same time: cat and wc
bot of those programs are bundled into one job that is being executes

so far:
foreground jobs:
we have looked at foreground jobs
those occupy our shell: Bash will wait for its completion before accepting a new command

to start background jobs in Bash:
[command] &

example:
ping -c 10 google.com &
the -c option limits the number of ping packets to 10
because of the & symbol, the command will be started as a background job
the output will still be displayed in the shell (unless we redirect it)
it will display the job ID and the last process ID

in case that we redirect the output, job is in progress, but shows up the status when some command will be executed
