escaping is also a feature that "rewrites" / expands our command as well
the single quotes disable all "rewrites" / expansions
also the backslash is disabled
this one does not print out a single single quote:
echo '\''
instead, this command is not yet finished, as the last single 
quote has not yet been terminated
