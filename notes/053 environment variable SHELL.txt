stores the path to the users default shell

important:
it is inherited just as a normal environment variable
so even if we start a bash
.. SHELL might be /bin/bash or /bin/zsh (if we using zsh as a default shell)

if we want to change it to zsh:
chsh -s "/bin/zsh"
chsh - change shell

it must be a shell that is listed in the file /etc/shells
it should then take effect after next logon
