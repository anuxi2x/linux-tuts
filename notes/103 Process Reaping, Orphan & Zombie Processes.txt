what happens when a process exits ?
first, most of the resources are made available again

parent process:

    child termination:
    when a child process terminates, the kernel sends a SIGCHLD signal to the parent
    the parent can then terieve the childs exit status

    process reaping:
    the parent process uses a system call (wait() or waitpid()) to collect the childs exit status
    this action is known as 'reaping' the child process
    in a bash, we can access the childs exit code: $? (if prints 0 (error code) - its ok, except 0 all numbers have some error)
    
    orphan process:
    if the parent process ends before the child, the child becomes an orphan and is adopted by the init process

zombie process:
a zombie process is a process that has finished executing but still ha an entry in the process table
this usually occurs when the parent process hasnt read the childs exit status yet

characteristics:
zombies can lead to process table overflow

zombie processes marked as Z (second column) in:
ls -lef

get maximum process id as we can use in our system:
cat /proc/sys/kernel/pid_max

zombie processes removed autamically
if not, they can be manually reaped with SIGCHLD signal to their parent
