what qutoes do:

echo $PWD/*.txt
echo '$PWD/*.txt'
echo "$PWD/*.txt"

no quotes:
all availble shell expansions are being applied

single quotes:
all exansions are disabled, word splitting is disables

double quotes:
disables most expansions, such as tilde expansion (~), filename expansion (*), word splitting
variable and parameter expansion are still working

the quotes only define how bash will expand / split the command
they do nothing else!
thus, this would be a completely vaild bash command:
echo 'hello' "world"
or this:
'echo' 'hello world'
