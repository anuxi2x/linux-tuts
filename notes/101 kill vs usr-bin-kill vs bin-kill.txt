kill vs /usr/bin/kill vs /bin/kill

lot of commands exists twice:
one time as a shell build-into
and one more time as an executable file

to check this:
type kill

kill is a shell built-in:
it means that shell is providing this functionality
when we call the kill command, we are not calling the executable file from the OS

kill provides additional functionality and behaves differently than the executable from the OS

to list all SIG - s
kill -l

/usr/bin/kill -l 
will perform signals without SIG prefix and numbers
