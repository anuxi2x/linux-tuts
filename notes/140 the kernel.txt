key functions of the kernel:
process management
memory management
file system management
networking stack
hardware abstraction layer (HAL) - enables applications to communicate with various devices


kernel modules
its piece of code that can be loaded into the kernel on demand
allows us to extend the functionality of the kernel

to list kernel modules:
sudo lsmod

lock kernel update on ubuntu:
sudo pat-mark hold linux-generic-hwe-22.04 - which is outputed from 'sudo apt search linux-generic-hwe'

lock kernel update on centos:
sudo dnf versionlock kernel

on centos we need to install dnf-command(versionlock):
sudo dnf install 'dnf-command(versionlock)'

How do we communicate with the hardware ?

communication layer:

User mode - User applications (bash, firefox,...)
User mode - System components (systemd, x11, Wayland,...)
User mode - C standard library: fopen, execv, malloc, localtime,...
Kernel mode - Linux kernel provides system calls: read, open, write, close,...
Kernel mode - Lix kernel to manage the hardware
Physical hardware (CPU, memory, storage, network,...)
