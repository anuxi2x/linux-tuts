dnf automatically removes no longer needed dependencies
let's have a look at an example:
python3-matplotlib
this tool has a dependency to python3-numpy (among many others)
thus, when we install python3-matplotlib, python3-numpy is installed as well

we can check that:
python3 -c 'import numpy as np'

if we now uninstall python3-matplotlib:
the package python3-numpy is uninstalled as well
if our application would depend on numpy... it would now fail:
python3 -c 'import numpy as np'

how to avoid this?
we could set an option to False in /etc/dnf/dnf.conf:
clean_requirements_on_remove=False

and then we would have to remove old dependencies manually:
dnf autoremove

we could remove a package without its dependencies:
dnf remove [package] --noautoremove

we can mark packages as installed manually:
dnf mark install [package]
