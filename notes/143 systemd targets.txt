target:
    groups units logically to a goal
    managed by .target unit files

to get the current default targer:
sudo systemctl get-default

to switch target, without rebooting:
sudo systemctl isolate multi-user.target

we can list available targets with the following command:
sudo systemctl list-units --type target --all

we could also change the current default target:
sudo systemctl set-default multi-user.target
