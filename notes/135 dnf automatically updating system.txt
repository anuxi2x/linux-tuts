general rule:
if a machine is a critical server, we should not use automatic updates
if a machine is not critical (and unplanned downtime is acceptable) we can consider opting into automatic updates

first, we need to install dnf-automatic:
sudo dnf install dnf-automatic
second, we should have a look at the configuration file:
sudo nano /etc/dnf/automatic.conf
third, we need to enable timer:
sudo systemctl enable -now dnf-automatic.timer
