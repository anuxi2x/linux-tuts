sometimes packages asks us questions when we install them or they run configuration when we install them on our system

Example:
bootloader (for example: grub) might want to install itself as the main bootloader

webserver might set itself up in a way that a user and group is created and that it automatically starts with our system 

display manager (manages the login screen) might start a dialog to ask us which one should be the default display manager

sometimes we want to re-run those scripts

we can do if with the following command:
sudo dpkg-reconfigure <package_name>

we install the package "locales" the first time

This packages asks us which locales we want to generate

What is a locale?
It defines how numbers and dates should be displayed
A lot of programing languages rely on the operating system to provide this functionality

For example, if we want to have a website (for example programmed in PHP), and we want to use the build-in functions to format dates
The corresponding locale must be generated
To reconfigure a package:
sudo dpkg-reconfigure locales
