grep
grep is a tool that can find a patter in an ourput or a file

basic usage:
grep -F 'pattern' file.txt

can also be used on stdin

grap and binary data:
grep works with every file - it will just find the pattern in the file
we could also execute grep on files that contain binary data

but we shouldnt:
we may find files we are not intending to fint
grep is mean to be used on text files, not on binary files
grep is slow on binary files
binary files may contain non-printable chars, or chars that changes the behavior of terminal once printed
