bash command invoke process is always the same:
1. first, the command is being expanded
2. the, word splitting is applied
3. quotes are being removed
4. command is being executed

this also applies to the program name that we want to execute!

alywas use double quotes for variables!!!
otherwise, word splitting will occur

Best practice:
try to refer to filenames in the same directory as ./file.txt
alywas use the quoting style that is as restrictive as possible
prefrer single quotes: 'hello world'
if this is not possible, use double quotes:
echo "hello ${USER}" or echo 'hello'"${USER}"
use no quoting only if theres no ambiguity, or you want all expansions to be applied:
example for no ambiguity:
ls -al
here we want all expansions to be applied:
echo ./*.txt
