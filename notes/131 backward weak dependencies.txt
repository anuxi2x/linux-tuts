so far, our dependencies were mostly forward dependencies:
we want to install package B that depends on package A
thus, we also install package A

what are backwards dependencies?
we have a package B that we want to install
we can imagine a backward dependency like this:
	another package C wants to say: Hey, i'd enhance the functionality of B, when installing B, install me as well
this is especially useful for third-party repositories, so they can connect to the install of existing packages

supplements:
	this package will be installed as a weak dependency if another package is installed

dnf repoquery --supplements [package_name]

of course, we can also check which package supplements another one:
dnf repoquery --whatsupplements [package_name]

enhances:
this package could enhance the functionality of another package, but do not install by default

dnf repoquery --enhances [package_name]
