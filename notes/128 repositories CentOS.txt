Repositories: where do our packages come from?

lets install dnf install tool:
dnf install gimp

repositores - place where dnf downloads our files

we can define those repositories in the following files:
/etc/dnf/dnf.conf
/etc/yum.repos.d/*.repo

a full system on RHEL / CentOs needs at least:
BaseOS - the core of operating system
AppStream - on top of BaseOS we need applications that AppStream can do

we dont have to refresh this index manually, dnf do this automatically
