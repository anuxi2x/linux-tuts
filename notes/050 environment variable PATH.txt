PATH stores a list of directories

modifying the PATH variable

PATH="${PATH}:/new/path"

common issue: command not found
in this case, we neec to verify the contents of the variable PATH
the desire directory should be included
the order of the entries in PATH must be correct

for program search:
which program_name
it outputs the program path

1. keep system directories at the beginning
2. place user-specific duplication of directories
3. avoid duplicates
4. minimize the number of directories to improve search efficiency]
