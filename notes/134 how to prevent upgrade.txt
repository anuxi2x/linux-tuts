to prevent package from being updated:
dnf upgrade --exclude=[package],[package2],...

or permanently exclude it in our /etc/dnf/dnf.conf:
excludepkgs=[package]

theres also a plugin for dnf:
dnf-versionlock (google it)

be careful:
preventing a package from being updated can cause problems with the dependencies

best practice:
we should review those packages from time to time and consider if its necessary to block updates
before large system upgrades, we should try to remove all excluded packages. This will allow DNF to update all software, and prevent many potential dependency issues
