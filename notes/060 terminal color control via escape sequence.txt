terminal capabilities: TERM

we can tell bash which abilities should be used by the environment variable: TERM
for example terminal contains: xterm-256color
there are different terminals available:
text-only terminals (no color)
terminal, that support 16 different color
terminal, that support 256 different color(xterm-256color)

we can list the availble modes:
toe - table of terminfo entries (in my case it doesn't work)

echo -e "\e[30;40m": 

-e: allow specific characters or escape characters
\e: create special escape characters, after that is not a text, its a special character
[ - defines terminal that we want to change something in the behavior
30: black foreground
40: black background
36: cyan foreground
41: red background
