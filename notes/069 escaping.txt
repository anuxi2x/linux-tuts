escaping - \

sometimes we want to disable Bash from performing the default actions
example:
we autocomplete a filename that contains a whitespace character
bash might autocomplete it to:
cat a\ file.txt

tt disables the normal behavior of the next character
here, that would be word splitting
thus, 'a file.txt' is the filename, that will be passed as an argument to cat 
(instead of 2 arguments: a and file.txt)
escaping would also allow us to print a single double quote in the following way: echo "\""

prefer to write it in this way: echo '"'

escaping is also a feature that "rewrites" / expands our command as well
the single quotes disable all "rewrites" / expansions
thus, also the backslash is disabled
thus, this one does not print out a single single quote: echo '\''
instead, this command is not yet finished, as the last single quote has not yet been terminated
