3 important levels of permissions:
Owner (u) 
Group (g)
Others (o) 

Type of permissions:
Read (r / 4): 
Allows viewing file contents or listing directory contents
Write (w / 2): 
Allows modifying file contents or creating / deleting files in a directory
Execute (x / 1): 
Allows running a file as a program or accessing a directory's contents

Assigning permissions to a file

Permission levels: Owner (u), group (g), others (o)
Type of permissions: Read (r / 4), write (w / 2), execute (x / 1)

Examples:
chmod u+x file.txt: 
Would give the owner (u) executable rights
chmod g-w file.txt: 
Would remove the write permission for the group(g)
chmod o+r file.txt: 
Would give other users (o) read access to this file or directory

Changing owner / group of a file

We can also change the owner / group of a file:
chown user:group file.txt

numerical permissions:

example:
chmod 754 file.txt

First digit is for the owner:
7 = 4 + 2 + 1 => read, write, execute
Second digit is for the group:
5 = 4 + 1 => read, execute
Third digit is for all others:
4 => Read
