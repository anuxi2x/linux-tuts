after the bootloader has given control to our kerner, the kernel will initializa and start the main process (PID = 1)
on most linux systems nowadays, its the systemd process
let look at ps program output:
ps 1

this process will then initiate all the rest:
start the System
mounting drives
starting services
configuring network connections
starting additional applications


the tool: systemd

systemd is not just a tool, its an extensive set of tools

systemd: General structure

system mode:
    systemd manages the boot process and starts all services required for this in parallel
    it reads in config file (unit files), builds the dependency graph, and then executes all commands necessary to get to the result
user mode:
    the same as system mode, but for user services (after the user logins)

systemd first 2 basic building blocks:

Unit:
    basic building block
    various types available: Service, Target, Timer,...
    Units can depend on another or each other

Service:
    represents a service that should run on our system
    can be enabled, disabled, started, stopped, restarted, reloaded,...
    managed by .service unit files

systemd manages "Units"
systemd searches units in various paths on our system
those paths are usually:
/lib/systemd/system (sometimes also /usr/bin/systemd/system): system configuration
this is default place for configuration for the maintainer (authors of our Linux distribution / packages)

/run/systemd/system : non-persistent, runtime configuration. Its cleares after reboot so we dont need to place configuration there

/etc/systemd/system :
    configuration for the administrators
    overwrites files from /lib/systemd/system
    this is where we should store our custom configuration

we could find systemd paths with this command:
systemd-analyze --system unit-paths

to read (cat) systemd file we should need to use this command:
systemctl cat wpa_supplicant.service

get status of a unit:
systemctl status [unit]

change the status of a unit:
systemctl {start, stop, restart, reload} [unit]
