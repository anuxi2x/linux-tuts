word splitting:
bash performs word splitting on our input
this happens, after our command has been (potentially) rewritten by expansions

for example:
touch a.txt b.txt

this command will be splitted into 3 different words:
touch
a.txt
b.txt

the first entry is program (touch)
a.txt the first parameter / argument
b.txt is the second parameter / argument

word splitting will occur at any character that is listed in the variable IFS
by default, this is every space, every tab, and every new line

we can disable word splitting by wrapping parts of the command into quotes:

touch 'a file.txt' and touch "a file.txt" - creates a single file
file name will be: a file.txt
