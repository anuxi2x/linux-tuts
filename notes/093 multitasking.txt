We let our CPU switch between those
If we switch fast enough, it will seem like we're running all programs at the same time
This switching is called scheduling
If our CPU switches from one program to another, it's called "context switch"

cat /proc/[process ID]/status | grep ctxt

ctxt: context switch

We can use the watch command:
This allows us to automatically re-execute a command

watch -n 0.5 grep ctxt /proc/12345/status
Refresh the output every 0.5 seconds
