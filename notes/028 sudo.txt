sudo temporarly elevate our privileges to superuser (root)

example: 
sudo ls /root
usually, we could not access this directory
only the root user can access it
but sudo elevates our privilages
this allow us to access it anyway

but be careful:
always make sure you understand what a command does
especially when sudo is involved

do not execute:
sudo rm -rf /etc - it destroys whole system
