sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt-get upgrade

this will install all available and possible updates - and even install additional dependencies (if they become necessary)
it will never remove any package from our system, even if the're no longer needed

sudo apt full-upgrade
sudp apt-get dist-upgrade
this will:
try to install all available and possible upgrades
uninstall dependencies if this is required in order to install the upgrade

example for this:
package A depends on package B (v1.0)
package A is updated, now depending on package C (v1.0), which conflicts with package B (v1.0)
package B is uninstalled during dist-upgrade / full-upgrade

Warning: dist-upgrade / full-upgrade
be careful with this 2 programs
it can remove programs you were relying on, in order to solve dependency problems

be sure to:
really read the output of what it wants to do
have a backup
have enough time to fix potential problems
