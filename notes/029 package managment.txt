package managment:
linux distributions offer a centralized way to install software
this process is called package managment
this is an enourmous benefit of many linux systems

also:
a lot of apps no longer need to include their own updater
(for example: chrome, firefox)

it works this way:
our system connects to centralized repos
they provide a list of available packages
this list can then be used to install updates, or install additional tools
