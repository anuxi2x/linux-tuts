After the BIOS / UEFI, the bootloader is the first software to load run on startup
Its goal is to load the operating system
How does it do it?
It loads the kernel into memory and then hands control to it
The bootloader is only responsible for this and thus active for only a very short time

We can change the configuration of GRUB in the following file:
/etc/default/grub
To update the GRUB configuration, after each change we must run:

On Ubuntu:
sudo update-grub

On CentOS:
sudo grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg

This will update the /boot/grub/grub.cfg file (we should never edit this file directly, as it would be overwritten during updates)
