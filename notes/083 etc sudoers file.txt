line in /etc/sudoers
username ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL

username: The username, this rule should be applied to this user
ALL: The hostname that this rule should apply to (ALL:ALL): The run configuration
The first ALL: The user that the user jannis can sudo into
The second ALL: The group that the user jannis can sudo into
If we don't specify this, we can only sudo into the root user
ALL: The command specification
We can also specify NOPASSWD:, to allow sudo without a password (potential security risk):
username ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL

/etc/sudoers.d/username - to make a custom sudo

We can also just allow specific programs:
username ALL= NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/apt-get 
This would give jannis access to only the program apt-get
This might also be a security issue:
I could also remove any program I want
I could install any program I want
Some of those programs might start a service that runs in the background... and executes files
Those then might be executed with additional privileges
