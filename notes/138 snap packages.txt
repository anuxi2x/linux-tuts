Snap is a centralized repository for complete applications:
People can publish their applications to that repository
If we install a snap application, we should make sure that we trust the authors!
We can have a look at the available packages here:
https://snapcraft.io/

First, we need to install snap:
EPEL must be activated for this!
dnf install snapd

systemctl enable --now snapd.service

We can install an application:
snap install firefox

to run:
snap run firefox


If you're running RHEL:
You need to consider if you really want to use snap
Snap is part of the EPEL project (epel-release, no support)
Snap might break commercial support
But it allows us to access certain software:
RHEL / CentOS Stream by default ships with an ER version of Firefox (ER = Extended Release)
But let's say we're a web developer... and depend on the latest version of Firefox for our work (and we're using RHEL)
In that case snap might be an option for us

Be aware:
This is something you may need to discuss with your system administrator
