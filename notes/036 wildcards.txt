? - matches any single character
[0-9] - square brackets allows to specify a character range
[a-z] - for example matches all letters from a to z
[A-Z] - for example matches all letters from A to Z (capital letters)
** - matches zero up to all characters (including /), so we can look in the subfolders too
shopt -s globstar - enables ** feature (in my case it doesnt work)

best practise to have ./* or something like this to work with files
. - our current directory
