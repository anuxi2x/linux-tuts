bash can rewrite our command before it is being executed
globbing recognizes and expands pre-defined wildcard characters
it will then search for files that match this pattern and expand (rewrite) our command
this allows us to easily access multiple files and file extensions

for example:
*.txt can access all the files with differrent file names and with the same .txt extensions
some_text.* can access all the files with some_text name, no metter what extension they have

Important:
the wildcard characters must not be quotes (in 'single' or "double" quotes)
globbing does not use regular expressions
