File permissions for directories:
Read (r): Access directory contents
Write (w): Add or remove files (we also need execute permissions for this though)
Execute (x): Enter and traverse directory

If we want to change permissions / ownership for a whole directory structure...
we can use the parameter -R:
chown jannis:jannis -R ./directory
chmod 777 -R ./directory
