sticky bit is an extra bit that we can set for all files or directories

for files:
obsolete, no longer used
it used tp indicate that an executable file can remain in memory to be loaded more quickly on next launch

for directories:
without sticky bit, any user with w+e permissions for a directory can rename / delete files in it
if the sticky bit is set, only the owner (and root) of a file or the directory can remove or delete a file

the sticky bit especially used for the /tmp folder

to set sticky bit:
chmot +t [folder]
chmod 1777 [folder]

to unset sticky bit:
chmod 0777 [folder]

to inspect sticky bit:
ls -l

if the file / directory also has executable permissions for others:
last character will be a 't'
otherwise, the last character will be a 'T'
