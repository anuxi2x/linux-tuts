we can also use the killall command for sending signals (included childs)
the difference to kill is, that we select the process by name

example:
kilall firefox

we can also send signal with killall command

syntax:
kilall -s [SIGNAL] [process-name]

On MACOS -s has different meaning. It will make the program more verbose and prevent any signal from being sent

syntax for MACOS:
killall -SIGINT firefox
