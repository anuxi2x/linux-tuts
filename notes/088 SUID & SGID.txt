SUID = Set User ID
we can set a special bit for executable files
if this bit is set:
the executable will gain the rights of the owner
this allows unpriviliged users to access priviliged resources

be careful:
This can be a major security issue if used improperly
On most systems, the SUID bit is limited to executable binary files
It is usually not supported for executable scripts (.sh, .py,...)
If we set it on our own programs, we can easily create major security vulnerabilities. Be extremely careful!

to inspect SUID bit:
ls -l [file]

example:
-rwsrwxrwx

lowercase s: SUID bit+execute bit
uppercase S: SUID bit, w/o execute bit

to set SUID:
chmod u+s file

important:
we should also limit write access to this file as much as possible

to inspect SGID bit:
ls -l [file]

example:
-rwxrwsrwx

lowercase s: SGID bit+execute bit
uppercase S: SGID bit, w/o execute bit

to set SUID:
chmod g+s file
