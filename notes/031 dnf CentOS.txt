On red hat (RHEL) we can use the tool dnf to keep our system up to date

whith just one command, we can keep our system up to date:
dnf upgrade or dnf update:
fetches the latest version of the package list
and upgrades our system

important:
dnf always keep the local package list up to date
we dont have to manually refresh it (in contrast to Ubuntu)

install/remove software

dnf install [package]
install an additional package on our system

example: 
dnf install epel-release
dnf install cowsay

dnf remove [package]
removes package from our system

important:
epel-release must be installed on our system
this adds additional package lists to be able to install additional tools on our system

sudo crb enable - need to install from additional repo

yum used to be a package manager on CentOS previously
nowdays, it is replaced by dnf

but yum commands still works perfectly:
yum install cowsay - for example
