Sometimes, we want to stop jobs that create output
We want to see the whole output of a program
And we don't want the program to just directly write to our terminal

there was a bash option called stty

stty is a tool to change / print the terminal line settings
by setting the tostop option, we can tell it to suspend the job if it creates any output
when we now start a background job it will only run until it creates any output
once it writes any output, the job will be suspended immadiately

stty tostop - enable feature
stty -tostop - disable feature
