apt - Advanced Package Tool

apt-get:
stable API, we should use this when we're writing scripts

apt:
API and parameters might change when deemed necessary

apt-get / apt needs to know which packages are available, and where it can download them from
we need to connect to central repositories, which provide our packages

repositories from the system:
/etc/apt/sources.list

additional (third party) repositories:
/etc/apt/sources.list.d/*

important:
those repositories provide a list with packages, their version and other information
we must fully trust those repositories
they could even replace existing software on our system

once we have our repositories, we need to update the 'package definitions'
this means, that we fetch the latest list of available packages from the repositories

sudo apt update / sudo apt-get update

if we want to install neofetch, we could now do it:
sudo apt install neofetch

this package is then installed - and all the dependencies (third party packages) needed to execute neofetch

apt will remember, which package we installed manually and which one just installed as dependencies

to install package without third party packages:
sudo apt install --no-install-recommends neofetch
