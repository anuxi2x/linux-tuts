software dependencies:
required resources by a software for its proper functioning
includes other software, libraries, or operaton system features
DNF will handle the resolution of dependencies for us
this happen recursively - also dependencies of dependencies will be installed

why do we need dependencies?
dependencies only need to be installed 1x on our system
this saves storage space and ensures apps all use the same dependencies

provides, requires,...

each package:
	can provie certain features:
		dnf repoquery --provides [package_name]
	... and also require certain features:
		dnf repoquery --requires [package_name]

we can also use this to find packages:
	we can also list which package provides a certain feature:
		dnf repoquery --whatprovides
	we can also list which package requires a certain feature:
		dnf repoquery --whatrequires

we can list dependencies with the following command:
	dnf deplist [program]
