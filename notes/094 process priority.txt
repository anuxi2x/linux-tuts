nice: 
used for set process priority
range: -20 - +19
-20: the highest priority
+19: the lowest priority

default niceness for new process is 0
Processes with lower niceness (higher priority) receive more time from the scheduler
We need administrative privileges to lower the niceness / increase the priority of a process
We don't need any privileges to increase the niceness / lower the priority of a process

Set the niceness for a program:
nice -n [niceness] [program]

We can also change the priority of an existing process:
renice -n 19 [process ID]
