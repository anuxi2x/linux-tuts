during the creation of a filesystem, space is reserved for inodes
this space cant be used for anything else

show how many inodes available:
df -ih
usually we cant never reach the limit

but if applications uses many small files:
this can be theoretically reached
processes or apps crash or cant be started
os crashes

to solve this:
no longer needed files can be removed
can be archived to (.tar)
filesystem can be recreated with a higher inode limit
data can be stored on additional drives
