The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt in one of the few human-readable strings, preceded by several ‘=’ characters.

strings -n 8 data.txt | grep -oP '=+\s*\K\S+'


Certainly! Let's break down the grep command: grep -oP '=+\s*\K\S+'

grep: This is a command-line utility for searching plain-text data sets for lines that match a regular expression.
-o: This option tells grep to only output the part of the line that matches the pattern, not the entire line.
-P: This option enables Perl-compatible regular expressions (PCRE), which provide more advanced pattern matching compared to basic regular expressions.
=+\s*\K\S+:
=+: Matches one or more '=' characters.
\s*: Matches zero or more whitespace characters (space, tab, etc.).
\K: Resets the start of the reported match. In other words, it discards everything that matched before this point.
\S+: Matches one or more non-whitespace characters.
So, the entire pattern is looking for one or more '=' characters, followed by optional whitespace, and then it captures (using \K) and outputs one or more non-whitespace characters. This pattern is designed to extract a password-like string that comes after several '=' characters and optional whitespace.
When applied to a line, this will output the password-like string without including the '=' characters and any preceding whitespace.


Certainly! Let's break down the strings -n 8 data.txt command:

strings: This is a command-line utility that extracts printable strings from a file containing binary data.
-n 8: This option specifies the minimum string length to be displayed. In this case, it sets the minimum length to 8 characters. The idea is that shorter sequences of characters are less likely to be meaningful words or phrases, so this helps filter out shorter, potentially irrelevant strings.
data.txt: This is the name of the file from which strings will extract printable strings.
So, when you run strings -n 8 data.txt, the command will extract and display all printable strings from the data.txt file that are at least 8 characters long. This is useful for identifying and extracting human-readable information from binary files, where the majority of the content might not be in a readable text format.
